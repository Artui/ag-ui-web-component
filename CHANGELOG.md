## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- `<ag-ui-chat>` Web Component over AG-UI: Shadow-DOM chat UI, a pluggable tool
  registry (`registerTool`), the `x-destructive` confirmation modal, and the
  DOM-driver + animation primitives.
- Durable conversation + resumable run loop that survives the full page reloads
  of a multi-page app: `SessionStorageStore`, a persisted thread id, and
  `x-navigates` checkpoints completed via `navigationResult` on the next mount.
- Host seams: `routeMap` (+ `list_routes` / `navigate_to_route`), an
  auto-injected `getPageMap` context, `registerStateHook`, and an optional
  client-side `navigate()` callback (SPA vs MPA).

### Notes
- First release — exercising the automated npm OIDC publish pipeline end-to-end.
