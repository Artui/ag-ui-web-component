# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Word text-animation no longer replays the whole message at end of stream.**
  `data-text-animation="word"` wrapped the finished assistant message into
  staggered `.word` spans on `TEXT_MESSAGE_END`, so a response that had already
  streamed in progressively re-animated itself one word at a time — awkward. The
  word reveal now runs only when the message arrived **at once** (a single text
  delta, history replay, or an error bubble); a message that streamed across
  multiple deltas keeps its progressive reveal and isn't re-wrapped.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Server-side tool results in the card.** The element now subscribes to
  AG-UI's `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` event and settles the matching tool-call card with
  the real server output (honouring the `data-tool-display` mode), instead of
  the generic "Executed on the server." placeholder — which remains only as a
  fallback when no result event is streamed.
- **Tool calls and results survive a page refresh.** History replay now
  reconstructs tool-call cards (from assistant `toolCalls`) and settles them
  from the persisted `tool` result messages, so a rehydrated transcript shows
  the full tool activity, not just the prose. Applies to every conversation
  store (the data was already persisted; only the replay was incomplete).

### Fixed
- **Pending indicator could hang after a server-only round.** A round whose
  tool calls were all server-side re-showed the "thinking" indicator after the
  run had already finished, leaving it stuck. The indicator is no longer shown
  speculatively for server tools, and a terminal `onSettled` guarantee clears
  it (and re-enables input) on every run-loop exit — including the
  `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` ceiling and errors.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Markdown + HTML rendering** in assistant message bubbles (`renderMarkdown`),
  sanitised with DOMPurify (scripts, event handlers, and `javascript:` URLs
  stripped; links hardened with `target`/`rel`). User messages stay literal.
- **Pending indicator** — an animated "thinking" indicator shown while the agent
  is awaited (before the first token and between tool rounds), honouring
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **New-chat button** in the header — clears the transcript, the persisted
  conversation, and the in-memory run state, and mints a fresh thread.
- **Collapse seam** — a reflected `collapsed` attribute, a built-in header
  toggle, a persisted (per-tab) collapsed state, and a `TOGGLE_EVENT`
  (`ag-ui-toggle`) so a host can drive its own chrome.
- **Tool-call display modes** (`TOOL_DISPLAY`, `data-tool-display`): `minimal`
  (name + status), `compact` (args + result behind one "Details" toggle), and
  `full` (the default; original behaviour).
- **Richer action animations**: `pressThenClick`, `selectOption`,
  `toggleControl` (+ `pressButton` / `selectControl` / `toggleCheckbox` driver
  wrappers), all honouring `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Dynamic route syntax**: `Route.path` supports `:name` placeholders;
  `navigate_to_route` substitutes path params (leftover params → query string)
  and `list_routes` advertises each route's `pathParams`.
- `X_CONFIRM_KEY` (`x-confirm`) tool metadata for a human-readable confirmation
  prompt.
- `setNativeValue` / `setNativeChecked` utilities (also used internally).
- **Theming** — a `theme` attribute (`light` / `dark` / `auto` / `code`); `auto`
  follows `prefers-color-scheme`, `code` is a monospace terminal palette. Plus a
  wider set of themeable `--ag-ui-*` variables.
- **Density + placement presets** — `density` (`comfortable` / `compact`) and
  `placement` (`bottom-left` / `side` / `full` / `embedded`); `embedded` drops
  the floating chrome and high z-index so the widget lives in the host layout.
- **Incoming-text animations** — `data-text-animation` (`none` / `fade` /
  `word`), the last revealing assistant text word-by-word; honours
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **`confirmPredicate`** — a per-call `(toolName, args) => boolean | Promise`
  hook deciding confirmation dynamically (authoritative over `x-destructive`).
- **Built-in `read_page` tool** — present when a `getPageMap` provider is set, so
  the agent can re-read the page mid-turn after acting.
- **`x-summary`** tool metadata (`X_SUMMARY_KEY`) — a friendly label shown on the
  tool-call card instead of the raw tool name.
- `observedAttributes` / `attributeChangedCallback` so a late `title-text`
  change updates the header.
- Accessibility: `role="log"`/`aria-live` on the transcript, `role="status"` on
  the pending indicator, `role="group"` on the confirmation card, input label.
- **Skills** — pre-defined prompts surfaced as **chips** (`data-prompt-chips`)
  and/or a **`/`-command palette** (`data-slash-commands`), both opt-in over one
  catalog. Catalog from the `skills` setter (`setSkills`), a `data-skills` JSON
  embed, and/or a fetched `data-skills-url` (merged backend → embed → client).
  Picking pre-fills the input (or auto-sends with `sendImmediately`); prompts
  support `{placeholder}`s filled from `skillContext`, with a missing value
  blocking the send and showing a hint. Exports the `Skill` type.

### Changed
- The destructive-action confirmation is now an **inline card in the transcript**
  (Confirm / Cancel, with the `x-confirm` message) instead of a focus-stealing
  modal overlay. `requestConfirmation` now renders inline; the
  `confirmation_modal` module was removed.
- **Framework-controlled inputs now work.** `fillField` / `typeInto` /
  `selectOption` / `toggleControl` / `setControlValue` set `value` / `checked`
  through the **native prototype setter** before dispatching `input`, so
  React/Vue/Svelte value-tracking sees the change (previously the field looked
  filled but host state stayed empty).
- **Framework interop:** reflecting **property setters** for `endpoint`,
  `toolDisplay`, and `collapsed` (React 19 assigns matching props as element
  properties — getter-only props previously threw).
- `registerTool` is now **idempotent** — re-registering a tool name replaces it
  instead of throwing (re-fired refs / React StrictMode).

### Fixed
- The Markdown/HTML allowlist now permits sanitised **`<img>`** (safe-scheme
  `src`, no event handlers); `javascript:` srcs and disallowed tags (e.g.
  `iframe`) are still stripped.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-01

### Changed
- CI: resolve the pnpm version from `package.json`'s `packageManager` only
  (dropped the conflicting `version` input in the release/test workflows).

### Notes
- First fully-automated release via the npm OIDC publish pipeline — 0.1.0 was
  the manual bootstrap publish that created the package.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- `<ag-ui-chat>` Web Component over AG-UI: Shadow-DOM chat UI, a pluggable tool
  registry (`registerTool`), the `x-destructive` confirmation modal, and the
  DOM-driver + animation primitives.
- Durable conversation + resumable run loop that survives the full page reloads
  of a multi-page app: `SessionStorageStore`, a persisted thread id, and
  `x-navigates` checkpoints completed via `navigationResult` on the next mount.
- Host seams: `routeMap` (+ `list_routes` / `navigate_to_route`), an
  auto-injected `getPageMap` context, `registerStateHook`, and an optional
  client-side `navigate()` callback (SPA vs MPA).

### Notes
- First release — exercising the automated npm OIDC publish pipeline end-to-end.
