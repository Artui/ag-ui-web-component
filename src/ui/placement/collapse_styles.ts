/* ── Collapse ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Collapsing shrinks the widget to the round floating launcher: the panel
   scales toward the launcher's corner and fades, the launcher pops in from the
   same point. Both halves are transform and opacity only, so the morph runs on
   the compositor and never reflows the host page.

   The host box keeps its expanded size, since animating it would animate
   layout and a dragged --ag-ui-width would fight the launcher's own size.
   Nothing paints there once the panel is gone, so the box only has to stop
   swallowing clicks: pointer events go to none and the launcher takes them.

   Two placements do not use it: "sidebar" slides to its rail (below), and
   "embedded" keeps its header bar, having no corner for a floating circle that
   would escape the host's layout. "page" has no collapsed state at all. */

     actually use it is not. Every collapse path here works by letting the host
     size to its content -- the in-flow ones set height: auto, the floating one
     leaves only the launcher -- and a flex or grid parent whose align-items is
     the default stretch value overrides all of it. The panel then hides and the box
     it occupied stays: a header bar over several hundred pixels of nothing.
     Every known consumer hit this, because putting the element in a flex column
     beside the page content is the obvious way to embed it. */

   Equal specificity to the placement rule above, so source order is what lets

/* The page placement has no collapsed state, so it offers no control for one.
   A dedicated route has no "away" to go to: shrinking it left a strip of
   application chrome fixed over a route that no longer had an owner, and this
   is the one placement where the launcher that would bring it back is hidden.

   Hiding the control is only half of it. The state has another way in -- the
   attribute can be written straight onto the element, and a value stored under
   a different placement is restored on connect -- and the JS guards that catch
   those cannot see an attribute set directly. So the placement neutralises the
   state here as well: with the collapse rules above no longer naming "page", an
   unguarded collapsed attribute would otherwise fall through to the generic
   rule that scales the panel away and drops pointer events, leaving nothing on
   screen and no launcher to press. */
