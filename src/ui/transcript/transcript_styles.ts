   The 1px box with clip-path, rather than width/height 0, is the shape that

/* A used-value reader for the four viewport-inset tokens, and the only
   reliable one. getComputedStyle().getPropertyValue() on an unregistered
   custom property hands back the substituted token stream, not a length: it
   returns "4rem" verbatim, and "calc(56px + env(safe-area-inset-top))" as
   "calc(56px + 0px)" -- which parses as NaN and takes the whole inset with it.
   Padding is a real property, so the same tokens come back resolved to px.

   visibility rather than display: none, because a box that generates no
   layout has no used values to read. Zero-sized, absolutely positioned and
   inert, so it costs nothing but the read.

   The padding gives that box the size of the tokens, which a card narrower than
   one of them would scroll to reach. Scrollable overflow counts a box as its
   transform draws it, so a scale of nothing takes it out of that count on every
   side and in either direction, and leaves what is read: the padding's used values,
   and the containing block a percentage resolves against. Position fixed would add
   no scroll either, and would change that block.

   From its own corner, which is inside whatever holds it, because the centre of the
   padding is not, and only Chromium has been seen to leave out a point with no area.
   So no test here can tell the origin is needed. */
